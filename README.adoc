= Gaea-specific README (A. Huth, 2/18/2022)

The following resources are helpful for installing Elmer:

 * http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=compilation:compilationcmake
 * http://www.elmerfem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=14949&hilit=cray&sid=387e0a978376057705ead7e557cb48b3#p14949
 * http://elmerfem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7246

Here, the cmake script is `./configure`, with the toolchain in `./cmake/Toolchains/toolchain.cmake`

 * Note that I have not been able to link in Trilinos or Zoltan correctly yet, despite the fact both are part of the cray-trilinos module (they may need to be installed and linked separately). However, I have never needed these libraries in the past, anyway

Optionally, the scattered2Dinterpolator and mmg external packages must be installed in `./scattered2Dinterpolator` and `./mmg`, respectively:

1. scattered2Dinterpolator: follow http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=solvers:scattered
   * Note that the most recent commits of nn do not seem to work. Try commit id d540ffe (10/23/2019)
2. mmg (for mesh adaptation): follow http://elmerfem.org/elmerice/wiki/doku.php?id=mesh:meshadaptation
   * Most recent commit seems to work?

Make sure to link both packages with -fPIC. For example, add -fPIC flags within scattered2Dinterpolator/nn-c/nn/CUSTOMISE (same for csa-c), and to ./mmg/mmg/build/configure.sh (see http://elmerfem.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7246). Scattered2Dinterpolator is very useful for reading in data, but MMg probably is not needed except for Calving2D/Calving3D (Greenland-style calving)?

According to `./config`, Elmer will install in `./..` and the directory will be labeled with the date as `Elmer_devel_mm-dd-yy`. I like to make a symbolic link to this directory (cd `./.. ; ln -s ./Elmer_devel_mm-dd-yy ./Elmer`). Then, add the following to the `~/.bashrc` to run Elmer from anywhere (`srun -n{nprocs} ElmerSolver_mpi`)
```
export ELMER_HOME=/lustre/f2/dev/gfdl/Alexander.Huth/Elmer
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ELMER_HOME/lib
export PATH=$PATH:$ELMER_HOME/bin
```
Run ctests from `./build`, noting that on Gaea, the serial Elmer/ice tests will fail unless you edit line 56 of `./elmerice/Tests/test_macros.cmake` as follows: `EXECUTE_PROCESS(COMMAND ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} 1 ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} ${ELMERSOLVER_BIN} ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS}`

 * This edit ensures that serial runs are executed as `srun -n1 ElmerSolver_mpi` (which reads the .sif in ELMERSOLVER_STARTINFO) rather than the default approach of `ElmerSolver foo.sif`, which will not work on Gaea.

The vast majority (~95%) of tests should pass. The few solvers that fail either: (1) probably do actually work OK, but their checksums have not been updated in a very long time to reflect minor changes in the code elsewhere; (2) Never seemed to work, e.g. Damage (Krug et al 2014)?; or (3) Rely on libraries we did not link (e.g. Trilinos, Zoltan, etc)

[.text-justify]
Elmer is a finite element software for numerical solution of partial differential equations. Elmer is capable of handling any number of equations and is therefore ideally suited for the simulation of multiphysical problems. It includes models, for example, of structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer and electromagnetics. Users can also write their own equations that can be dynamically linked with the main program.

Elmer consists of several parts. The most important ones are ElmerSolver the finite element solver, ElmerGUI the graphical user interface, and ElmerGrid the mesh creation and manipulation tool. Also a visualization tool, ElmerPost, is included in the package but it is no longer developed.
